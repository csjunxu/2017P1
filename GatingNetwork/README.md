Code used in the paper: 
"The Return of the Gating Network: combining generative models and discriminative training in natural image priors" 
by Dan Rosenbaum and Yair Weiss

If you use this code please cite our paper. 


demo.m - a demontration of using the GMM prior and a fast gating network 
         for denoising and deblurring.

demoTrain.m - a demonstration of how to train the GMM (generative) 
              and the gating network (discriminative).


coming soon: training an inference network for Karklin and Lewicki's model,
             and using it for denoising.
